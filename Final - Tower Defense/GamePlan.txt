Tower Defense
-----------------------
Theme: Computer Virus

- Enemies are virus things

Enemy
----------------
- Save enemies as they spawn into a list
- When they reach last waypoint remove

-TODO: Check the odd distance off from the turning point, and add a part of that to earlier moves 

Enemy Pathing
----------------
- Level saves x,y of turning point for the enemies
- Save rectangle from one turning point to the next turning point(path rectangle)
- When enemies get to last turning point, lower players health

Towers
----------------
- When placing tower make sure it's rectangle doesn't intersect with path rectangles
- Radius from tower to determine if enemy is within range
- Iterate through list of enemies and grab first enemy within range to attack
- Can upgrade to other towers
